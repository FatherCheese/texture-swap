1. Make a folder in your texturepack named "textureswap"
2. Make a txt file, change the filetype to .json and follow this example;
{
  "textures": [
    {
      "itemName": "item.tool.axe.diamond",
      "entries": {
        "Verigans Hammer": 0
      }
    }

3. Make a folder in textureswap that matches the itemName, but replace . with _
